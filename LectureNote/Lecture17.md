### Lowest level: ethernet segment
- ethernet segment consists of a collection of hosts connected by wires to a hub
- spans room or floor in a building

### next level: bridged ethernet segment
- spans building or campus
- bridges cleverly learn which hosts are reachable from which ports and then selectively copy frames from port to port

### next level: internets
- multiple imcompatible LANs can be physically connected by specialized computers called routers
- the connected networks are called an internet

### internet protocol
- provide a naming scheme
- provides a delivery mechanism

### TCP/IP protocol family
- IP
    - provide basic naming scheme and unreliable delivery capability of packets from host-to-host
- UDP
    - uses IP to provide unreliable datagram delivery from process-to-process
- TCP
    - uses IP to provide reliable byte streams
